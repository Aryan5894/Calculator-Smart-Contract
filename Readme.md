# Calculator Smart Contract

## Project Title

**Calculator Smart Contract**: A simple Solidity smart contract that provides basic arithmetic operations on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Description

This is a basic smart contract built in Solidity, which allows users to perform four simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It demonstrates how to write and deploy basic smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, making it easy to integrate into decentralized applications (dApps) that require arithmetic calculations.

The contract includes safety checks, such as preventing division by zero, and provides a simple interface to interact with the contract.

## Contract Address
0xF2D23414A3936c812945270a6D8b52099410a509
 
 ## Project Vision

The vision behind this project is to showcase how simple smart contracts can be used for basic functionality on the blockchain. While this contract may not provide much utility in isolation, it can serve as the foundation for more complex dApps that require reliable and decentralized arithmetic functions.

In the future, this project could be expanded to support more complex mathematical operations, stateful computations, or integrate with other decentralized systems such as oracles for dynamic input.


## Key Features

- **Addition**: Perform the addition of two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
- **Division**: Divide two numbers with a check to avoid division by zero.
  
The contract uses the following key elements:
- **Pure functions**: All functions are marked as `pure`, meaning they do not modify the contract's state and only operate on the provided inputs.
- **Safety checks**: Includes a `require` statement to prevent division by zero in the `divide` function.
